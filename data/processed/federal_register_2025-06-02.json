This proposed AD was prompted by an updated analysis of an event involving an International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) Model PW1127GA-JM engine, which experienced a high-pressure compressor (HPC) 7th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-7) separation that resulted in an engine shutdown and aborted takeoff. This proposed AD would require repetitive angled ultrasonic inspections (AUSIs) of certain high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disks and turbine hubs for any crack indications, and if necessary, removal from service and replacement, and removal from service of certain HPT lenticular seal assemblies.

AD 2024- 10-13 requires visually inspecting the bowls of the left-hand (LH) and right-hand (RH) fuel filters for any cracks and seepage. Depending on the inspection results, AD 2024-10-13 requires removing an affected fuel filter from service and replacing that part. AD 2024-10-13 also allows a certain fuel filter to be installed on any helicopter if certain actions are accomplished. Since the FAA issued AD 2024-10-13, additional inspection criteria was developed. This proposed AD would require the same actions as AD 2024-10-13 but would remove some helicopters from the applicability, add an inspection of the inner surface of the fuel filter bowls, and revise the tightening torque.

The draft guidance is the second in the ICH M13 series of guidances and describes the scientific and technical aspects of study design and data analysis to support bioequivalence (BE) assessment for additional strengths of orally administered immediate-release (IR) solid oral dosage forms (i.e., tablets, capsules, and granules/powders for oral suspension), including considerations for biowaivers. The intent of this draft guidance is to provide harmonized criteria and data that support waivers for drug applications with multiple strengths when in vivo BE has been demonstrated for at least one strength using the principles outlined in the final guidance \"M13A Bioequivalence for Immediate-Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms\" published in October 2024.",

    "abstract": "In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on May 22, 2024. The collection involves the information that each applicant for an aircraft dispatcher certificate or FAA approval of an aircraft dispatcher course must submit to the FAA. These applications, reports and training course materials are provided to the local FAA Flight Standards District Office that oversees the certificates and FAA approvals. The collection is necessary for the FAA to determine qualification and the ability of the applicant to safely dispatch aircraft. Without this collection of information, applicants for a certificate or course approval would not be able to receive certification or approval. The collection of information for those who choose to train aircraft dispatcher applicants is to protect the applicants by ensuring that they are properly trained.",
